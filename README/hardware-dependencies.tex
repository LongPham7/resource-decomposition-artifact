\section{Hardware Dependencies}

The Docker image can only run on x86 architectures.
%
The image contains pre-built releases of
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A linear-program solver CLP~\citep{CLP}, which is used inside an
        implementation RaML~\citep{RaML,Hoffmann2017} of the static resource
        analysis AARA~\citep{Hofmann2003,Hoffmann2011a,Hoffmann2022}
        (\labelcref{introduction:instantiation:1,introduction:instantiation:2});
        and
  \item An SMT solver Z3~\citep{DeMoura2008}, which is used inside the
        semi-automatic resource-analysis tool TiML~\citep{WangWC17}
        (\labelcref{introduction:instantiation:3}).
\end{enumerate}
%
These releases, which are downloaded from their respective GitHub repositories,
are specific to x86 architectures.
%
Unfortunately, the specific versions of CLP and Z3 used in the artifact do not
have corresponding pre-built releases for other architecture (e.g., ARM
architectures used in Apple silicon).
