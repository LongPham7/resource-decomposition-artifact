# Modifications necessary for RaML

## Merge sort

There is no need to modify RaML for the counter-instrumented version.

## Quicksort

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Bubble sort

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Heap sort

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Huffman code

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Unbalanced binary search tree

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Balanced binary search tree

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Red-black tree

For the counter-instrumented version, we need to set the list qs_max of LP
variables for the highest-degree cindices to the list `[43; 1149; 9015]`. They
are the three LP variables that do not involve the counter variable at all.

## AVL tree

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Splay tree

For the counter-instrumented version, we need to set the list qs_max of LP
variables for the highest-degree cindices to the list `[57; 7056; 7526]`. They
are the three LP variables that do not involve the counter variable at all.

## Prim's algorithm

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Dijkstra's algorithm

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Bellman-Ford algorithm

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.

## Kruskal's algorithm

There is no need to modify RaML for both the counter-instrumented version.
