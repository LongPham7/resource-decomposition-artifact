== quicksort :

  [int list; int list * 'a] -> int list * (int list * 'a)

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
         3  <--  ([::(*)], ([::(*)], *))
       0.5  <--  ([], ([::(*)], *))
         1  <--  ([], ([], *))

  Non-zero annotations of result:
       0.5  <--  ([], ([], *))

  Simplified bound:
     1 + 0.5*L + 3*L*M
   where
     L is the number of ::-nodes of the 1st component of the 2nd component of the argument
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the 1st component of the argument
